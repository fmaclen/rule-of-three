The rule of three is used to calculate the corresponding values proportionally.

It is also known as **Direct Proportion**, which means that any increase in the known values increases the unknown value at the same rate.
This _Direct Proportion_ or _Rule of three_ calculation uses the formula: `(y * b) / a = x`

### Example
Considering `2kg (a)` of flour is worth `$5 (b)`
What's the cost of `5kgs (y)` of flour at the same rate? `Answer = (x)`

`(5kg * $5) / 2kg = $12.5`
